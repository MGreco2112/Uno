# Uno: Java CLI Capstone

This was our first experience with Agile.  
As a team of Five we began each session reviewing each member’s
 state of code from last session’s goals. With everyone caught up and
logic errors sorted we then outlined the minimum goals and stretch
 goals for the next meeting, with focus placed upon meeting just
  the minimum viable goals prior to anything else.
 Independent coding then began, with pair coding and mob
coding sessions available upon request from team members.
 As team lead I ran the flow of these meetings, though 
 it was more a formality as the scope of the project and
  progress of the team dictated the meeting flow more so than my
   own directions did.


## Code Features

This project utilizes a continuous loop, running a switch case of options for each User Input prompt listed through a Scanner System. Using a for loop with a situational incrementer or decrementer variable, active user rotation is dynamic in either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation. Methods are broken up so that each single method either executes a single, specific process or dictates the control flow of other methods to be executed. All output is displayed in the JRE Terminal
